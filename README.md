# Generative-Models-for-Video-Prediction
Utilize multiple model architectures to improve sharpness in video prediction


## Datasets
Atari Datasets [11] originally intended for RNN(Recurrent Neural Network)usage, consists of recorded game play of 5 old Atari console games. This Thesisuses all 5 of them on different models as well as on 2 reference works as baselinefor the models. Below are some details and samples from all 5 games.
Space Invaders : 1331762 training images 434316 validation images 20(e)
Q*bert : 1124726 training images 360062 validation images 20(c)
Ms. Pacman : 1172401 training images 381757 validation images 20(a)
Video Pinball : 901479 training images 295328 validation images 20(b)
Montezuma’s Revenge : 1783796 training images578075 validation images 20(d)
